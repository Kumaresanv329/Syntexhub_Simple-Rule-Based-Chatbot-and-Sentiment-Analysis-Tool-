I’m happy to share that I have completed Week 2 projects of my 
Artificial Intelligence Internship at @SyntexHub 

-Week 2 Projects:
> Simple Rule-Based Chatbot  
   - Built using pattern matching  
   - Supports intents like greeting, help, and small talk  
   - Includes a small knowledge base  
   - Logs full conversation history via console  

> Sentiment Analysis Tool  
   - Preprocessed text data (cleaning & tokenization)  
   - Converted text into numeric features using TF-IDF  
   - Trained a Naive Bayes classifier  
   - Evaluated model performance and predicted sentiment for user input  

These projects helped me strengthen my understanding of:
> Rule-based AI systems  
> Natural Language Processing (NLP)  
> Text feature extraction  
> Machine learning model training & evaluation  

Grateful to SyntexHub for this hands-on learning experience
